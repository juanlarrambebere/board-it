# Board it App

Board-it is an application to manage projects.

## Disclaimer:

An application to manage projects is much more complex than Board-it. This is an MVP with a minimal feature set.

# What is possible to do?

1. View existing tasks.
2. Create new tasks with `name`, `description` and `status`.
3. Edit a task (the status can be edited either in-line or via drag&drop)
4. Delete a task.

# Out of scope

1. Users. It would be desirable to know which user created which task as well as who is assigned to a task.
2. Projects. It would be nice to be able to create projects that group tasks and have members.
3. Attributes. At the moment Board-it knows only one "status" attribute. Ideally, users should be able to create custom attributes at the project level and be able to use them to filter / create special views etc.
4. Authentication and Authorization. Users would have to authenticate themselves in order to access their projects/tasks.

# Architecture

Board-it es una aplicaci√≥n cliente servidor. El siguiente diagrama ilustra la arquitectura.

## Front-end

The frontend is a React app made with Nextjs.

## Backend

The backend exposes a GraphQL API using [Hasura](https://hasura.io/). Why not REST? I have nothing against REST, in fact I have much more experience with rest APIs, but for this MVP it seemed reasonable to expose a quick GraphQL API and focus on the web-app.

# Deploying to production

## The app is up and running, you should be able to play around with it at [Board-it](https://board-it-phi.vercel.app/)

## CI

No CI tools were configured for simplicity. In the future it'd be a must.

## CD

Deploying to production is as simple as merging a PR to master.

The frontend is deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and is configured to deploy the `frontend` folder every time something is merged into master.

The backend is deployed to the [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/), and likewise, it is configured to deploy the `backend` port every time something is merged to master.

# Development

You'll need to run both projects in two different terminal windows/tabs.

1. Fetch the latest changes from git

```
git checkout master && git pull origin master
```

## Backend

See [Backend readme](./backend/README.md)

# Frontend

See [Frontend readme](./frontend/README.md)

# Note:

Since the app uses web sockets, you should be able to open the same app in two different browser tabs, do things like creating tasks, editing/deleting them and see the changes in both tabs!
